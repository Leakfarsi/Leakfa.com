A simple way to know if you are on the list of major security breaches like "HIBP", but it is specific for Iran. 

## Service content
This product provides inquiry and tracking services for individual leakage events in Iran (Republic Islamic of Iran).
Informs users know whether they exist in the list of major security data breaches, and tries to increase their information security literacy.

## Technical details
To improve website security and increase users trust, the SHA-1 hash function is used to identify and return the information to the server, which can also prevent developers from secretly collecting users data.

## Service idea
Given that a large number of data breaches incidents were reported in March and April 2020, and most organizations did not actively notify users of these personal information leakages, we tried to provide a method using one-way identification to help Iranians check whether their information has been leaked.
